# Popular-Movies-App-Stage2
Popular Movies Stage 2 add more features that includes trailers, reviews and favorites. This app is part II of the Popular Movies App in Stage. 
# Note
In this stage I am adding additional functionality to the app I built in Stage 1.

# Functionality
-allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
-allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
-allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
-modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
